    text: "Diego and his crew completely transformed our kitchen in Greer Ranch. We went from builder-grade oak cabinets to custom white shaker cabinets with soft-close everything. The dovetail drawers are gorgeous and the fit is absolutely perfect. He even matched the crown molding to our existing trim so it all looks like it was always there. Worth every penny.",

    text: "Hired First Class WoodWorks for a bathroom remodel in our master suite. Custom double vanity with granite tops, new tile, updated plumbing fixtures. Diego stayed on budget and finished two days early. The vanity has more storage than we even expected. He thought of details we wouldn't have considered.",

    text: "Kitchen remodel in California Oaks. Took our cramped galley layout and opened it up with a huge island and custom cabinetry. The 3D rendering he showed us before starting was spot on to the final result. Diego does everything in-house which made scheduling so much easier than dealing with multiple subs.",

    text: "Custom closet built-ins for the master bedroom. Clean lines, adjustable shelves, shoe cubbies, a pull-out hamper. Diego measured everything down to the fraction of an inch. The closet feels twice as big now even though nothing moved. Fast turnaround too.",

    text: "We got quotes from four different cabinet companies for our Wildomar kitchen. Diego was not the cheapest but he was the most thorough. He brought samples, explained the difference between plywood and particle board, showed us the Blum hardware. After seeing the finished product we know we made the right call. These cabinets will outlast the house.",

    text: "Our Canyon Lake lake house needed a complete kitchen overhaul. Diego designed custom cabinets that actually use the weird angled walls we have instead of fighting them. Pantry pull-outs, lazy susans, even a hidden spice rack behind the range hood panel. The attention to detail is something you just don't get from big-box stores. He also did the granite countertops so everything matched perfectly. Highly recommend.",

    text: "Full kitchen remodel including custom cabinets, quartz countertops, new island with seating, and a built-in pantry with roll-out trays. Diego walked us through every material choice and was honest about what was worth spending on and what wasn't. His team showed up on time every single day, kept the workspace clean, and finished on schedule. The kitchen is the nicest room in the house now. If you're looking for a cabinet maker in Murrieta who actually cares about the work, this is the one.",
