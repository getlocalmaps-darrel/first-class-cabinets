    text: "Diego and his crew completely transformed our kitchen in Greer Ranch. We went from builder-grade oak cabinets to custom white shaker cabinets with soft-close everything. The dovetail drawers are gorgeous and the fit is absolutely perfect. He even matched the crown molding to our existing trim so it all looks like it was always there. Worth every penny.",

Diego stayed on budget and finished two days early. The vanity has more storage than we even expected. He thought of details we wouldn't have considered.",

    text: "Kitchen remodel in California Oaks. Took our cramped galley layout and opened it up with a huge island and custom cabinetry. The 3D rendering he showed us before starting was spot on to the final result. Diego does everything in-house which made scheduling so much easier than dealing with multiple subs.",

    text: "We got quotes from four different cabinet companies for our Wildomar kitchen. Diego was not the cheapest but he was the most thorough. He brought samples, explained the difference between plywood and particle board, showed us the Blum hardware. After seeing the finished product we know we made the right call. These cabinets will outlast the house.",

    text: "Our Canyon Lake lake house needed a complete kitchen overhaul. Diego designed custom cabinets that actually use the weird angled walls we have instead of fighting them. Pantry pull-outs, lazy susans, even a hidden spice rack behind the range hood panel. The attention to detail is something you just don't get from big-box stores. He also did the granite countertops so everything matched perfectly. Highly recommend.",

Diego walked us through every material choice and was honest about what was worth spending on and what wasn't. His team showed up on time every single day, kept the workspace clean, and finished on schedule. The kitchen is the nicest room in the house now. If you're looking for a cabinet maker in Murrieta who actually cares about the work, this is the one.",

The soft-close Blum hinges and full-extension drawers make such a difference day to day. Extremely professional from start to finish.",

Everything is mounted solid to the studs and the doors close perfectly. Diego even added LED lighting under the uppers. Best upgrade we've done to the house.",

The painted finish is smooth and even, the hardware placement is consistent, and the open shelves are solid enough to hold our heavy cast iron. He understood the vision from day one.",
