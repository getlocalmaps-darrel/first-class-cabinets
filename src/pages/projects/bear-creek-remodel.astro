          <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-zinc-900">Luxury Woodworking Behind the Gates of Bear Creek</h2>
          <p>
            This transformation by <a href="/" class="text-yellow-600 font-bold hover:underline">First Class Woodworks</a> took us into the private gates of <strong>Bear Creek</strong>&mdash;one of Murrieta's most prestigious gated communities.
            As a premier <strong>custom cabinet maker in Murrieta</strong>, we focus on high-ticket estate projects near the <strong>Bear Creek Golf Club</strong> and the <strong>Tenaja corridor</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The homeowners wanted to replace their existing kitchen with <strong>100% in-house custom cabinetry</strong> that matches the upscale architecture of the estate.
            Unlike the prefabricated cabinets found at Home Depot or Lowe's, every cabinet was measured, designed, and built specifically for this home&mdash;no standard sizes, no filler strips, no compromises.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-zinc-900 pt-4">Materials &amp; Craftsmanship</h2>
          <p>
            The cabinetry in this Bear Creek kitchen is built entirely from <strong>furniture-grade plywood</strong> with <strong>dovetail drawer boxes</strong>&mdash;the same joinery technique found in heirloom furniture.
            Face frames are joined with <strong>mortise-and-tenon construction</strong>, providing structural integrity that particle board simply cannot match.
            Every drawer and door runs on <strong>Blum undermount slides and soft-close hinges</strong>, backed by a lifetime warranty for whisper-quiet, maintenance-free operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We finished the cabinetry with a <strong>post-catalyzed conversion varnish</strong>&mdash;a professional-grade coating used in high-end custom shops.
            Unlike standard house paint that can chip, peel, and yellow over time, conversion varnish creates a chemically bonded surface that resists heat, moisture, and daily wear for decades. In the warm Southern California climate, this makes a significant difference.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-zinc-900 pt-4">Custom Fireplace Surround</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond the kitchen, this project includes a <strong>handcrafted fireplace surround and mantel</strong> that anchors the main living area.
            Designed as a single cohesive package with the kitchen cabinetry, the fireplace built-in uses matching wood species, hardware, and finish to create a unified look throughout the estate's primary living spaces.
            This is the kind of architectural detail that <a href="/services/cabinet-maker" class="text-yellow-600 font-bold hover:underline">only a dedicated cabinet maker</a> can deliver.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-zinc-900 pt-4">Serving Bear Creek &amp; All of Murrieta</h2>
          <p>
            Whether we are working inside the gates of <strong>Bear Creek</strong>, up the hill in <strong>La Cresta</strong>, or across town in <strong>Los Alamos Hills</strong> and <strong>Greer Ranch</strong>,
            our mission is to set the standard for luxury <a href="/services/kitchen-remodeling" class="text-yellow-600 font-bold hover:underline">kitchen remodeling</a> in the Temecula Valley.
            Based right here in Murrieta at <strong>24491 Avenida Arconte</strong>, we are local craftsmen who know every neighborhood, every building style, and every permit requirement in the 92562 area.
