  {
    question: "How much do custom kitchen cabinets cost in Temecula?",
    answer: "Custom kitchen cabinets in Temecula range from $35,000 to $75,000 or more based on wood selection, layout complexity, and finish grade. Our pricing reflects furniture-grade plywood, Blum lifetime-warranty hardware, and precision fitting — a long-term investment that outperforms every big-box alternative in Wine Country homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the top-rated custom cabinet maker in Temecula?",
    answer: "First Class WoodWorks holds an A+ BBB rating and 5.0-star reviews from Temecula homeowners across Redhawk, Harveston, and Wine Country. We are the only local cabinet maker that builds, finishes, and installs every piece in-house with zero subcontractors."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build wine storage cabinets for Temecula homes?",
    answer: "Yes. Living in Temecula Wine Country means proper wine storage matters. We build temperature-conscious wine cabinetry with individual bottle cradles, humidity-sealed compartments, and integrated cooling zones using the same furniture-grade hardwoods found in our kitchen cabinetry."
  },
  {
    question: "What Temecula neighborhoods does First Class WoodWorks serve?",
    answer: "We serve every Temecula community including Redhawk, Harveston, Paloma del Sol, Vail Ranch, De Luz, and the Wine Country estates. Our shop in nearby Murrieta provides fast turnaround for all projects in the 92591 and 92592 zip codes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a custom kitchen remodel take in Temecula?",
    answer: "A complete kitchen remodel with custom cabinetry typically takes 8 to 12 weeks from design approval to final installation. This timeline includes 3D renderings, material procurement, precision fabrication, and a full conversion varnish cure for a flawless, long-lasting finish."
  },
  {
    question: "Are custom cabinets better than IKEA for Temecula homes?",
    answer: "IKEA cabinets use particle board boxes in fixed sizes, requiring filler strips and sacrificing storage. Our custom cabinets are built from furniture-grade plywood to your exact wall dimensions, maximizing space and surviving the Inland Empire heat that causes particle board to swell and delaminate."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer 3D kitchen design renderings in Temecula?",
    answer: "Every Temecula project includes complimentary 3D design renderings so you can visualize your new kitchen before fabrication begins. We take precise laser measurements in your home and present photorealistic views of cabinet layouts, finishes, and hardware selections during your consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of wood is best for Temecula kitchen cabinets?",
    answer: "We recommend furniture-grade plywood for box construction with solid Maple, White Oak, or Alder face frames. These hardwoods handle the Temecula Valley's temperature extremes without warping, unlike the MDF and melamine used in retail cabinets that fail within a decade."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a kitchen remodel increase home value in Temecula?",
    answer: "In the 92591 and 92592 zip codes, a high-end kitchen remodel with custom cabinetry typically returns 60 to 80 percent on investment. Custom cabinets are the number one feature luxury buyers seek in Temecula's competitive Wine Country real estate market."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build custom bathroom vanities in Temecula?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We build moisture-resistant custom vanities, floating units, and linen towers for Temecula master suites. Every bathroom piece is sealed with post-catalyzed conversion varnish to prevent the finish cracking and wood swelling common in big-box vanities."
  },
  {
    question: "Is First Class WoodWorks licensed for work in Temecula?",
    answer: "Yes. We are fully licensed, bonded, and insured for finish carpentry throughout Riverside County including all Temecula neighborhoods. Our A+ BBB accreditation and compliance with the California Residential Building Code guarantee professional, code-compliant installations."
  },
  {
    question: "What hardware do you use on Temecula custom cabinets?",
    answer: "We install Blum TANDEM undermount slides and CLIP top soft-close hinges on every project. Blum hardware is Austrian-engineered for over 200,000 open-close cycles with a lifetime warranty — the industry gold standard for luxury Temecula kitchen cabinetry."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build custom entertainment centers in Temecula?",
    answer: "Yes. Our hand-crafted entertainment centers and fireplace surrounds start at $8,000 and are designed to conceal wiring, accommodate specific TV sizes, and integrate seamlessly with your existing cabinetry style. We serve Temecula homes from Redhawk to De Luz."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I schedule a cabinet consultation in Temecula?",
    answer: "Call 951-973-1265 or visit our contact page to book a free in-home consultation. We serve all Temecula zip codes and typically schedule visits within one week. You will receive laser measurements, design concepts, and a detailed written estimate at no cost."

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-zinc-900 mb-4">Why Temecula Homeowners Choose Custom</h2>
            <p>
              The Temecula Valley real estate market rewards quality. When you invest in <a href="/services/custom-kitchen-cabinets" class="text-yellow-600 font-bold hover:underline">custom kitchen cabinets</a>, you are adding permanent equity to your home. Retail cabinets from chain stores arrive in fixed 3-inch increments and require filler strips to hide gaps. Our <strong>master cabinet maker</strong> team measures your walls to the 1/16th of an inch, delivering a seamless fit that maximizes storage and eliminates wasted space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every Temecula kitchen project begins with a free in-home consultation where we capture laser measurements and produce <strong>3D design renderings</strong>.
