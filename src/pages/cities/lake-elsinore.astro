const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much do custom cabinets cost in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "Custom cabinets in Lake Elsinore typically cost $500 to $1,200 per linear foot depending on wood selection, finish complexity, and design details. Custom vanities range from $400 to $3,000, and built-ins start around $1,200. This investment delivers furniture-grade plywood construction with Blum lifetime-warranty hardware — engineered to withstand the lakeside humidity that destroys retail particle board."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the best cabinet maker near Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "First Class WoodWorks is the highest-rated cabinet maker serving Lake Elsinore with an A+ BBB rating and 5.0-star reviews. We build every cabinet in-house using furniture-grade materials and install with our own licensed, bonded, and insured finish carpentry team."
  },
  {
    question: "What Lake Elsinore neighborhoods do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all Lake Elsinore communities including Canyon Hills, Tuscany Hills, Rosetta Canyon, Terra Cotta, and the Historic Downtown area. Both the 92530 and 92532 zip codes receive the same precision craftsmanship and responsive service from our nearby shop."
  },
  {
    question: "Does lakeside humidity damage kitchen cabinets in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "It absolutely damages retail cabinets. Particle board and MDF absorb moisture from the lake microclimate, causing swelling and delamination. Our cabinets use furniture-grade plywood sealed with post-catalyzed conversion varnish — a moisture-proof barrier specifically chosen for lakeside environments."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a custom cabinet project take in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "Custom cabinet projects in Lake Elsinore take 8 to 12 weeks from design approval through installation. This timeline includes 3D rendering review, material procurement, precision fabrication, and a complete conversion varnish cure that ensures long-term moisture resistance near the lake."
  },
  {
    question: "Are custom cabinets a good investment for Lake Elsinore homes?",
    answer: "Yes. In the competitive Lake Elsinore market, custom kitchen cabinets typically return 60 to 80 percent on investment. Buyers actively seek upgraded cabinetry in the 92530 and 92532 zip codes, making custom builds one of the highest-ROI home improvements available."
  },
  {
    question: "What wood resists humidity best for Lake Elsinore kitchens?",
    answer: "We use furniture-grade plywood for box construction with solid Maple or White Oak face frames. These materials resist moisture absorption far better than MDF or particle board. Combined with our post-catalyzed conversion varnish finish, your cabinets are armored against Lake Elsinore's humidity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build custom bathroom vanities in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in moisture-resistant bathroom vanities, floating units, and linen towers for Lake Elsinore master suites. Our conversion varnish finish creates a waterproof barrier that prevents the swelling and finish cracking common in retail big-box vanities."
  },
  {
    question: "Is First Class WoodWorks licensed to work in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "Yes. We are fully licensed, bonded, and insured for finish carpentry throughout Riverside County including all Lake Elsinore neighborhoods. Our A+ BBB accreditation ensures every installation meets California Residential Building Code standards for quality and safety."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free cabinet consultations in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "We provide complimentary in-home consultations throughout Lake Elsinore where we take laser measurements, discuss your design vision, and create 3D renderings of your new cabinetry. Call 951-973-1265 to schedule — most appointments are available within one week."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build custom closets and entertainment centers in Lake Elsinore?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We build walk-in closet systems from furniture-grade hardwoods and hand-craft entertainment centers designed to conceal wiring and fit specific dimensions. Every piece receives the same Blum hardware and conversion varnish finish as our kitchen cabinetry."
  },
  {
    question: "What finish protects cabinets from Lake Elsinore's climate?",
    answer: "We apply post-catalyzed conversion varnish, a professional-grade finish that creates a chemical-resistant, moisture-proof barrier. Unlike the spray lacquer on retail cabinets, our finish prevents yellowing, resists water damage, and maintains its factory-fresh appearance for decades near the lake."

              The lakeside microclimate that makes <strong>Lake Elsinore</strong> such a desirable place to live also creates a unique challenge for cabinetry. Elevated humidity levels near the water cause particle board to swell, MDF to warp, and retail finishes to crack within a few short years. <a href="https://www.firstclasswoodworks.com/" class="text-yellow-600 font-bold hover:underline">First Class WoodWorks</a> is the <strong>cabinet builder in Lake Elsinore</strong> that solves this problem permanently.
