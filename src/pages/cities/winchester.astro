  {
    question: "How much does custom cabinetry cost in Winchester?",
    answer: "Custom kitchen cabinets in Winchester range from $35,000 to $75,000 or more based on wood species, kitchen size, and finish complexity. This investment delivers furniture-grade plywood construction with Blum lifetime-warranty hardware — a permanent upgrade over the builder-grade particle board in most Winchester homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the best cabinet maker near Winchester, CA?",
    answer: "First Class WoodWorks is the highest-rated cabinet maker serving Winchester with an A+ BBB rating and 5.0-star reviews. We build every cabinet in-house at our Murrieta shop and install with our own licensed, bonded, and insured finish carpentry team — no subcontractors."
  },
  {
    question: "What Winchester neighborhoods do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve all Winchester communities including Liberty, Thompson Ranch, Silverhawk, and homes near Diamond Valley Lake. The entire 92596 zip code receives the same precision craftsmanship and responsive service from our nearby Murrieta shop."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a custom cabinet project take in Winchester?",
    answer: "Custom cabinet projects in Winchester typically take 8 to 12 weeks from design approval to professional installation. This includes 3D rendering review, material procurement, precision fabrication, and a complete post-catalyzed conversion varnish cure for lasting durability."
  },
  {
    question: "Are soft-close cabinets safer for families with children?",
    answer: "Yes. Our Blum soft-close hinges and undermount slides eliminate finger-pinching hazards by decelerating doors and drawers before they close. For Winchester families with young children, this safety feature combined with heavy-duty construction prevents the slamming that damages retail cabinets."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace builder-grade cabinets in my Winchester home?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Builder-grade particle board cabinets installed in new Winchester construction begin degrading within five years in the Inland Empire heat. Upgrading to furniture-grade custom cabinets increases storage, improves daily function, and boosts your home appraisal value."
  },
  {
    question: "What wood species do you recommend for Winchester kitchens?",
    answer: "We use furniture-grade plywood for cabinet boxes with solid Maple, White Oak, or Alder face frames and doors. These hardwoods handle the extreme heat near Diamond Valley Lake without the warping and delamination found in MDF and melamine alternatives."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build custom bathroom vanities in Winchester?",
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in moisture-resistant custom vanities, floating units, and linen towers for Winchester bathrooms. Every piece is sealed with post-catalyzed conversion varnish, a professional-grade barrier that prevents the moisture damage common in retail vanities."
  },
  {
    question: "Is First Class WoodWorks licensed to work in Winchester?",
    answer: "Yes. We are fully licensed, bonded, and insured for finish carpentry throughout Riverside County including Winchester. Our A+ BBB accreditation ensures every installation meets California Residential Building Code standards for safety and craftsmanship."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free consultations for Winchester homeowners?",
    answer: "We provide complimentary in-home consultations throughout Winchester. Our team takes laser measurements, discusses your design vision and storage needs, then creates detailed 3D renderings for your approval before fabrication. Call 951-973-1265 to schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "What hardware do you install on Winchester custom cabinets?",
    answer: "Every project features Blum TANDEM undermount slides and CLIP top soft-close hinges with a lifetime warranty. Blum hardware is Austrian-engineered for 200,000-plus open-close cycles — whisper-quiet, family-safe performance that outlasts any retail cabinet hardware."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build custom closets and entertainment centers in Winchester?",
    answer: "Yes. We build walk-in closet systems from furniture-grade hardwoods and hand-craft entertainment centers designed to conceal wiring and fit your exact specifications. Every piece receives the same Blum hardware and conversion varnish finish as our kitchen cabinetry."
