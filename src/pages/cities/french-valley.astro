  {
    question: "How much do custom kitchen cabinets cost in French Valley?",
    answer: "Custom cabinets in French Valley typically cost $500 to $1,200 per linear foot depending on wood species, layout complexity, and finish grade. Custom vanities range from $400 to $3,000, and built-ins start around $1,200. This reflects furniture-grade plywood construction with Blum soft-close hardware — built to outlast the builder-grade particle board found in most new French Valley homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the best cabinet builder in French Valley?",
    answer: "First Class WoodWorks is the highest-rated cabinet maker serving French Valley with an A+ BBB rating and 5.0-star reviews. Based in adjacent Murrieta, we build every cabinet in-house and install with our own licensed, bonded, and insured finish carpentry team."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas in French Valley do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve the entire French Valley area within the 92596 zip code including Auld Valley, Glenoaks, the Wine Country corridor communities, and all master-planned developments. Our Murrieta shop neighbors French Valley directly for fast, responsive project service."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I upgrade builder-grade cabinets in my new French Valley home?",
    answer: "Yes. Builder-grade cabinets in new French Valley homes use particle board and melamine that degrade within five years in the Inland Empire heat. Upgrading to furniture-grade custom cabinets immediately increases storage capacity, home value, and visual impact."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a custom cabinet project take in French Valley?",
    answer: "Custom cabinet projects in French Valley take 8 to 12 weeks from design approval to installation. This timeline includes 3D rendering review, material selection, precision fabrication in our Murrieta shop, and a complete conversion varnish cure for lasting protection."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you design custom pantry systems for French Valley kitchens?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We design floor-to-ceiling custom pantry systems with pull-out shelving, spice racks, and adjustable storage tiers. Unlike wire pantry kits from retail stores, our pantries are built from furniture-grade plywood with Blum soft-close slides for daily heavy use."
  },
  {
    question: "What wood works best for French Valley kitchen cabinets?",
    answer: "We recommend furniture-grade plywood for cabinet boxes paired with solid Maple, White Oak, or Alder face frames. These hardwoods handle the temperature extremes in the 92596 zip code without the warping, swelling, or finish failure common in MDF and melamine."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build custom bathroom vanities in French Valley?",
    answer: "Yes. We build moisture-resistant custom vanities, floating units, and linen towers for French Valley master bathrooms. Every piece is sealed with post-catalyzed conversion varnish that provides a chemical-resistant, waterproof barrier against daily steam and humidity."
  },
  {
    question: "Is First Class WoodWorks licensed to work in French Valley?",
    answer: "Yes. We are fully licensed, bonded, and insured for finish carpentry throughout Riverside County including French Valley. Our A+ BBB accreditation and California Residential Building Code compliance ensure professional, code-approved installations on every project."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free consultations for French Valley homeowners?",
    answer: "We provide complimentary in-home consultations throughout French Valley. We capture laser measurements, discuss design preferences, and deliver detailed 3D renderings so you approve every cabinet detail before fabrication begins. Call 951-973-1265 to schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "What hardware comes standard on your French Valley custom cabinets?",
    answer: "Every project includes Blum TANDEM undermount slides and CLIP top soft-close hinges with a lifetime warranty. Blum hardware is Austrian-engineered for 200,000-plus cycles, delivering whisper-quiet operation that far exceeds the roller slides in builder-grade cabinets."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build entertainment centers and media walls in French Valley?",
    answer: "Yes. We hand-craft custom entertainment centers, fireplace built-ins, and media walls for French Valley living rooms. Each unit is designed to conceal wiring, fit your specific dimensions, and match your kitchen cabinetry for a cohesive whole-home finish."

            <p>
              French Valley is booming. New master-planned communities along the <strong>Wine Country corridor</strong> and throughout the <strong>92596</strong> zip code are transforming this area into one of Southwest Riverside County's most desirable addresses. But behind the fresh stucco, most builders install the same particle board cabinets that fail within five years of Inland Empire heat. <a href="https://www.firstclasswoodworks.com/" class="text-yellow-600 font-bold hover:underline">First Class WoodWorks</a> is the <strong>cabinet maker in French Valley</strong> that replaces that compromise with heirloom-quality craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a licensed, bonded, and insured finish carpentry firm with an A+ BBB rating, we build every cabinet from furniture-grade plywood with dovetail drawer boxes and <strong>Blum soft-close hardware</strong> that carries a lifetime warranty. Our shop in neighboring Murrieta means your project gets the same rapid service as our hometown clients.
